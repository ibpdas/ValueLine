## 📌 Concept in 30 seconds

In my experience, public sector leaders care deeply about outcomes, but it is hard to show how data work actually gets us there.

Foundational activity is essential, yet explaining its contribution to maturity, behaviour change and public value is always a challenge.

**ValueLine** is the model I use to make that line of sight visible.  
It shows how strengthening foundations leads to better behaviours, stronger systems and, ultimately, better impact.

It grew out of years of watching teams deliver important work but struggle to tell a clear value story.

**ValueLine helps me:**

- show which actions and decisions really drive value  
- bring leaders with me using plain English and a clean causal chain  
- surface constraints, dependencies and trade offs  
- balance quick wins with long term value creation  

It shifts the conversation from **"Why is value slow?"** to **"What must change now, next and later?"**

---

## 1. What problem this model solves for me

I work in a federated environment where no single team controls the full data value chain.  
That makes it difficult to show:

- how foundational work creates the conditions for value  
- why behaviour change is essential before outcomes improve  
- why different types of results move at different speeds  

### The challenges I see repeatedly

- unclear attribution  
- competing priorities  
- fragmented collaboration  

Data teams build the conditions.  
The wider system determines the outcomes.

### Why this matters

When the line of sight is unclear, organisations:

- focus effort in the wrong places  
- invest without addressing root causes  
- misread progress  
- miss chances to collaborate  
- experience delayed or diluted impact  

### How I use ValueLine to fix this

ValueLine breaks the journey into three causal levels. Each moves at its own pace:

- **Level 1: Foundations**  
  What data teams co design and shape.

- **Level 2: Maturity**  
  How the organisation behaves once foundations take hold.

- **Level 3: Outcomes**  
  The measurable public value that emerges later.

### What leaders gain from this view

It helps leaders see:

- what unlocks value now versus next versus later  
- why early signals matter even if outcomes lag  
- which constraints and dependencies determine progress  
- why foundational shifts must come first  

### What ValueLine is (and is not)

ValueLine is a causal explanation tool, not a standard or benchmark.

- It does not estimate wider social or economic value.  
- It is not designed for national or sector wide strategies with very different incentives and value mechanisms.  
- It is not a data management or capability framework.

It sits alongside those frameworks by explaining **how value is created**, not prescribing detailed practice.

### Compliance versus value

I often see strong compliance driven data management but limited strategic value.  
ValueLine helps separate the two and refocus conversations on impact.

---

## 2. How the model works

### Four parts that make the line of sight clear

**ValueLine works by combining three levels, three indicators and three measurement methods, all wrapped in a simple, practical theory of change.**  
This is the core engine of the model.

---

### 2.1 The three levels - what changes over time

These levels describe how value emerges in a federated organisation.  
They move at different speeds and involve different actors.

**Level 1 - Foundations**  
What data teams and partner teams directly shape:  
strategy alignment, leadership, shared standards, common tooling, communities of practice.

**Level 2 - Maturity**  
How the wider organisation behaves when foundations start to work:  
reuse, interoperability, confidence, evidence based decisions, better collaboration.

**Level 3 - Outcomes**  
The value that becomes possible once maturity strengthens:  
savings, time reduction, efficiency gains, improved services, public good impact.

> **Purpose:** Gives leaders a clean causal chain:  
> foundations → maturity → outcomes → impact.

---

### 2.2 The three indicators - how fast results appear

Each level moves at its own pace.  
Indicators help set expectations realistically and avoid value panic.

**Leading indicators (early signs)**  
Show whether Level 1 foundations are in place.  
Examples: adoption of standards, engagement, shared tooling uptake.

**Signal indicators (behaviour change)**  
Show how the organisation responds.  
Examples: reuse, interoperability, reduced duplication.

**Lagging indicators (measurable value)**  
Show the benefits once maturity takes hold.  
Examples: financial savings, time savings, user satisfaction, improved outcomes.

> **Purpose:** Explains why leaders cannot expect Level 3 results before Level 1 and Level 2 shifts occur.

---

### 2.3 The three measurement methods - how evidence is built

ValueLine uses a **mixed method evidence model**, because no single metric can capture change across all levels.

**Quantitative methods**  
Clear, repeatable measures of performance and activity.  
Examples: savings, adoption, API usage, time saved.

**Qualitative methods**  
Insights that explain why behaviours shift.  
Examples: sentiment, user research findings, case studies.

**Economic and experimental methods**  
Independent validation of longer term value.  
Examples: Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR), Net Present Value (NPV), counterfactuals and experimental designs.

> **Purpose:** Ensures evidence is balanced and credible, and not skewed by one type of metric.

---

### 2.4 Theory of change wrapper - how everything connects

The theory of change ties the model together in a simple sequence:

- **If** Level 1 foundations improve  
- **then** Level 2 maturity behaviours strengthen  
- **which enables** Level 3 outcomes to appear  
- **subject to** key dependencies, constraints, leadership decisions and system conditions  
- measured through a blend of quantitative, qualitative and economic evidence  

It is not a technical construct.  
It is a practical explanation of **how value actually flows** in a federated system.

> **Purpose:** Turns ValueLine into a decision tool rather than just a descriptive diagram.

---

## 3. Executive decision box

I use the **Executive Decision Box** to translate the model into focused leadership asks.

It brings together insights from the three levels, indicators and evidence into a simple view that highlights:

- decisions leaders need to take  
- key trade offs  
- critical dependencies  
- confidence levels  
- what to focus on now, next and later  

In a federated system, this is essential because progress and value depend on decisions made across many teams, not just the data function.

---

## 4. Why this model works

In my experience, ValueLine works because it:

- reflects how federated organisations actually operate  
- clarifies the difference between contribution and attribution  
- prevents unrealistic expectations around outcomes and timing  
- makes invisible value visible  
- helps leaders focus on the small number of shifts that matter most  
- reduces repeated work and misaligned effort  

It reframes data strategy from a list of activities to a **map of how value is created**.

---

## 5. How I use the model in practice

ValueLine helps me and my teams to:

- explain data strategy impact in a holistic way  
- engage senior leaders with more confidence and clarity  
- identify where to invest next in Level 1 (conditions) or Level 2 (maturity)  
- align directorates or arm's length bodies within federated departments without turning it into a league table  

I find it particularly useful for:

- CDO and data leadership teams  
- portfolio, PMO and governance groups  
- strategy, policy and finance partners  
- performance, evaluation and benefits leads

## 8. Limitations

A few important limitations to keep in mind:

- All data used here is **synthetic**.  
- The dashboard is a **learning and facilitation tool**, not an official scorecard.  
- It is not a benchmark, standard or assurance framework.  
- Attribution remains approximate and will always involve judgement.  
- Evidence quality varies and should improve over time as better data and methods are used.  
- Outcomes and impact can lag by years, especially in complex systems.  
- Maturity scores are directional, not absolute or audited.

Real decisions should always rely on your own evidence, governance and professional judgement, with this model as a supporting lens rather than a single source of truth.

---

## 9. Contributing and reuse

You are welcome to:

- fork and customise  
- propose improvements through issues or pull requests  
- share alternative layouts or metrics that help other public sector teams  

Attribution is optional but appreciated.

If you build on this, I would be interested to see how you adapt it in your context.

## 10. Why I created ValueLine

**ValueLine** grew out of years of leading data strategy work in complex, federated environments.

Across many conversations with colleagues and after reviewing more than fifty data strategies and business cases, I kept seeing the same pattern:

- strong foundational work was happening  
- the story of progress was hard to explain  
- expectations drifted  
- value signals arrived late  
- the link between foundations, maturity and outcomes was often lost  

I created ValueLine as a practical, repeatable way to make that connection clearer.

If it helps even a few teams focus on what matters and explain their impact with more clarity, it will have done its job.
